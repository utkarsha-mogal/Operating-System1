Q.3] 
Write a C/CPP program to create a child process. Child should print its pid and its parent’s pid and should exit by printing message as “Child Exiting …”. Parent should print its pid and should exit by printing message as “Parent Exiting ..”. 
(Hint(functions to be used) : getpid, fork, getppid)

int main (){
    pid_t pid;

    pid = fork();
    if(pid ==0)
        printf("The child process is running- pid %d, ppid %d \n", getpid(), getppid());
    else if(pid > 0)
        printf("The parent process is running - pid %d, ppid %d \n", getpid(), getppid());
    else
        printf("Error creating new process through fork() \n");

    exit(0);
